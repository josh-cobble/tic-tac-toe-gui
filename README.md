# tic-tac-toe-gui

Welcome to 5x5 TicTacToe! 2 players are required for this game. One player will be Player X and the other will be Player O. Player X always goes first and Player O always goes second. To play this game, Player X starts by clicking on any square--this will print an X on that square. Then, Player O will go next, printing an O on any square not used by X. Whoever can get 5 X's or 5 O's in a row (this can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If no one is able to do this, the game ends in a tie.

To start a new game, press the new game button on the left-hand side of the screen.
